<br/> Breeding is the first non-face-to-face platform service between dog owners and trainers. 
All the members except me work in South Korea and the company was established in South Korea. 
I participated in this project remotely while working on my Ph.D. program.

I initially started this project to learn how to write proposals to receive investment. However, 
fortunately, several continuous investments have led to the current business.
None of the early members had ever imagined it to be this successful.

In this post, I demonstrate our business in the order of most important things to get invested as a startup. 
1. Business model and market size
2. App development
3. Team members

Another important parts of our business are marketing and securing great trainers as many as possible.
I ommmited in this post, but other members, **Sanghee Park**, **Myeongjin Jeong**, and **Yelim Kim**, have 
done exceptional jobs on that.

**_Unfortunately, I'm now out of this business for academic reasons._**


Awards that _Breeding_ received and a startup pitch:
- **Excellence Award with $80,000 Grant** in K-­Startup (ChungChung) Contest in South Korea (Nov ‘20)
- **Top Award** in Youth Startup Awards, Youth and Future Corporation in South Korea (Oct ‘20)
- **Pre-­Startup Package with $50,000 Grant**, Ministry of SMEs and Startups in South Korea (Sep ‘20)

### 1. Business Model and Market Size

#### Business Model

According to our investigation and surveys, dog owners and freelance trainers both are experiencing 
the following difficulties with current visiting training system.

- **Dog owners**
  - Expensive price - average cost of one visiting training is 250-300 dollars.
  - Fragmented information getting from blogs
  - Lack of trust in freelance trainers
  - Lack of aftercare service
  - Anxiety when bringing outsiders into the house.

- **Trainers**
  - Significant lack of opportunity to work unless working at famous training centers
  - Difficulties in customer management and administrative affairs
  - Marketing difficulties to attract customers

As far as we know, _Breeding_ is the first non-face-to-face mobile platform (in South Korea) that connects 
customers who need dog training with freelance dog trainers and can lead a healthy pet culture. As shown on 
the figure above, we provide four service features to address the aformentioned difficulties.

- **Non-face-to-face Training System** - reducing a training cost about 80% for dog owners and travel time for trainers
- **Big Data Based Training Suggestion** - for specific dog breeds, ages, and personalities based on accumulated data in the service
- **Marketing and Customer Management** - reducing a significant time and burden for trainers
- **Real-time Review Sharing** - providing an availabiltiy to share honest reviews between users


By providing the services in between, _Breeding_ charges **8% of borkerage fee** to trainers. It is cheaper compared 
to the average brokerage fee of 15 percent for other platform services in South Korea, and we surveyed and told by
trainers that 8% would be reasonable to pay. 

On next section, I will demonstrate our expected revenue with respect to a market share in details.

#### Market Size and Estimated Revenue

<img src="../images/posts/breeding/market-revenue.png" alt="drawing" width="100%" style="margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 0px;"/>

In order to receive investment from investors, we also had to prove that the pet training market was big enough 
and growing rapidly. In South Korea, the average interesting market size for investors is at least 
600-800 million dollars.
Left figure above shows **exponential estimated growth of pet training market pie** 
(orange colored) in the entire pet-related market, 620 million dollars in 2026.  

Table on the right shows _Breeding_'s estimated revenue with respect to our expected market share every year. 
In five years (2025, orange colored), **estimated revenue of our service is 5.9 million dollars**. 
It is not surprising that we estimated 8% of market share in five years since we are the first platform service 
that connects dog owners and trainers in the current market. We believe that it is possible.

### 2. App Development

Above images show our app's user-flow designed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) prototyping tool. It is a
great tool supporting app designers to build interactive prototypes. 

Here are features we provide in the app:
- Login, register, find password, and settings
- Pet story and user reviews
- Training program suggestions
- Finding trainers either in supporting training programs or in time
- User profiles - both for dog owners and trainers
- Private chat and video call between a dog owner and a trainer


Initially, we planned to build the service as a corss-platform mobile app. However, after funded by Korean government,
we had to show a completely working service and meaningful data in a short term to a person in charge.
Therefore, we changed the plan and decided to build a prototype service first with responsive website.

We had meetings with six different outsourcing companies and signed a contract with one of them.
Below are example pages of the task order document that we gave to the company. 
The document contains flowcharts, screen design details, expected timeline, and all other agreements required. 


<img src="../images/posts/breeding/work-order.png" alt="drawing" width="80%" style="margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 0px;"/>


Now, our website has launched. It is running with AWS's EC2/RDS and uses [SendBird](https://sendbird.com/) service 
for chat and video call. Since we designed it thinking that it would be developed as a mobile app, it currently 
has significant limitations:
- Users won't receive a real-time notification after they close the website.
- To start a training session with video call, a dog owner and a trainer should be sitting in front of 
their computers when the training starts. 
- Unstable quality of video call

Nevertheless, it was and is still the best decision we could make. 
It is important to demonstrate feasibility of our service and create meaningful data (actual transactions and reviews) to 
receive subsequent investments at this stage.
Also, even if we created a cross-platform mobile app with a small amount of money, 
lots of features would be required to be added, removed, and updated anyway. This costs a lot and is almost
similar to building a new app entirely.
Thus, it was a good decision to build a prototype quickly with responsive website in a short term. 

After work with the outsourcing company was done, my main job was to add features, fix minor issues, and maintain the service.
Not shown on this post, but there is an administrator page as well to manage our users. Below is a landing page of our website
that we built.

### 3. Team Members

<img src="../images/posts/breeding/team-members.png" alt="drawing" width="100%" style="margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 0px;"/>



This startup project has initially started with upper-left three members, and now we have three more members:
(1) **Hyoyoung Park**--full stack developer, (2) **Yelim Kim**--marketing/HR, and (3) **Seungho Lee**--designer.
All our members are great and enthusiastic.

Thanks to all the team members for giving me a great opportunity to learn how to begin a startup from 
scratch and to learn about startup infrastructures in South Korea. As the business grows, it began to make no 
sense that the CTO works remotely from the United States and in parallel with PhD research, so I had to hand 
over to the rest of the team on July 2021. However, I am confident that the business can grow further because 
the remaining team members are exceptional and passionate.
