### Logic of Lifetime Memory
According to [Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), people get a stronger memory when they are able to recall it longer period of time.

So, Mocket gives tests in certain periods.

As shown on the above picture, it gives tests everyday for first three days. After that, the period gets longer, and this helps users to memorize words for lifetime.
